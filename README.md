# AutocorrectProject

Overall, the goal of the project is to streamline the process of outputting a close match String based on the input.

This idea as a whole formed when I worked on the project found [here](https://github.com/PostAPProject/BobaFridaysForm). 
We wanted to recommend close matches when a user typoed and tried to order something not on the menu.

## Attempt 1

Attempt 1 is just a copy of the feature that I implemented in 2019. I used a weight system to decide the closest matches
and printed those with the highest weights. The weight system consists of counting matching letters.

First, I wanted to print the menu items with the most matching letters with the user's input.
 - But entering the whole alphabet prints the entire menu

Then I wanted to print the menu items that have the most matching letters in the same spots.
 - But a missing letter in the beginning of the user input makes the slots an off by one error

Lastly, I decided to just print the menu items where at least 50% of the word is a common substring.

Pros üòÑ
 - If the program outputs something, the correct answer is among them
 - Typing the entire alphabet does not print the entire menu

Cons ‚òπÔ∏è
 - Time complexity is horrendous
 - Gave a 50% common substring threshold in order to be considered
   - Intended to limit the amount of common menu items like "Milk Tea" popping up as many menu items share the same words
   - Only counters one or two typos or errors, and only if the error is not exactly in the center of the input
   - Sometimes no suggested menu items are printed

## Attempt 2

Attempt 2 uses the min distance Leetcode problem that just tracks the number of edits (delete, replace, insert) to convert
one string to another.

We return the strings that require the least edits.

Pros üòÑ
 - It actually returns the correct answer if it exists

Cons ‚òπÔ∏è
 - Runtime is somehow worse than Attempt 1
 - If one of the options has low letter count, it is going to show up in the results regardless of the input
